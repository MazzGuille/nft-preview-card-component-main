# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution
## My process
Hello! Since I am not a pro user I only got the image files, my first step was to break down the image into the different "blocks" I'd be using, I used the square propety on figma to create this blocks (link for reference https://www.figma.com/file/gYh8SqE8XispbWSW4SEzEI/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) once I got a clear idea of the "blocks" I started structuring my HTML, after that I went onto CSS used a general property of: (* {
  box-sizing: border-box;})

  In order to get the exact colors of the SVG files, I inspected the HTML with firefox (best browser to inspect by far)

  I finished by making some minor changes to some fonts and margins, fell free to check out the full code on https://github.com/MazzGuille/nft-preview-card-component-main.git.

  Happy coding!
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned

I didnt know about <hr> nor <span> those two tags were exetremely helpfull for this challenge

### Continued development

I want to learn more about styling and HTML structure, still not sure when to use a <section> instead of <p> or stuff like that.
